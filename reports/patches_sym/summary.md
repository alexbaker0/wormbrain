# Chemotaxis results

Test set: 32 fixed starts per arena, never used in training. Reward = mean concentration over the second half minus the start (fraction of peak), minus 0.05 x mean power, minus 0.5 x max(0, 1 - path speed / 0.1 mm/s). 'Concentration gain' leaves out both penalties. 'reached' = ends within 1 mm of the main peak.
